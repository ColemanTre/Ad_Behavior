# Ad_Behavior

The purpose of this project is to use simulated data to imitate interaction with ads on the app produced by Opine.

Data was simulated using basic R packages and the tidyverse packages.

Models were created using the caret packages.

It's difficult to draw conclusions from this data because the simulated data is completely random. Running these models on actual data will allow for prediction and inference.
